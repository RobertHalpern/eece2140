# Projectile Graphical Simulator
##  EECE2140 Final
### Authors: Robert Halpern, Nathan Evans, Roha Sajid

Final Project for EECE2140. Simple projectile simulation program in Python.


1.Our project was intended to be a fun way to simulate projectile motion using a pirate theme while still insuring real world accuracy.



2.To run our code you should run the main.py file, This will open a new window with a ship on waves. Then, using your mouse you can drag where you want to aim the cannon and by draging your mouse farther away from the ship you can control the speed on the cannonball. Everytime you fire the cannon it will save the trejectory of the cannonball as a .csv file which you can open in greater detail using graph.py by running command: python graph.py trajectory_xxxxxxxx_xxxxxx.csv If you just want to open a more detailed graph of your most recent shot you can instead just type: python graph.py and the program will automaticcly pen the most recent saved trajectory.

3.Our simulator requires the use of the following libraies: pygame, math, csv, os, matplotlib.pyplot, glob and sys.

4. Our approach to this project was to ensure that our motion simulator was simple and fun to use but still contained real world accuracy and detail.
